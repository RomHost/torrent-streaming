### What is BitTorrent? ###

BitTorrent is file sharing software. You need four things to have BitTorrent work: a BitTorrent client, a BitTorrent tracker, a file to share, and a torrent file (made from the file to share.) The torrent file is placed where others can have access to it (i.e. a website.)  

The clients use the torrent file to connect to the tracker, this allows the client to find other peers to get the file from. This is the simplest explanation
